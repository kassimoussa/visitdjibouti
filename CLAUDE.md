## Architecture

### Mobile User Authentication System
The application features a complete authentication system for mobile app users with revolutionary anonymous user support:
- **Separate AppUser Model**: Mobile users stored in `app_users` table, isolated from admin users
- **ðŸš€ Anonymous User System**: Progressive onboarding without friction - users can use the app immediately
- **Laravel Sanctum**: API token authentication for both anonymous and registered users
- **OAuth Integration**: Google and Facebook social login via Laravel Socialite
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for email/password, social authentication, and anonymous usage
- **Progressive Registration**: Anonymous users can convert to full accounts while preserving all data
- **Multilingual Support**: User preferences for language (French, English, Arabic)
- **Complete Profile Management**: Full CRUD operations for user profiles

#### Authentication Endpoints
- **Public Routes**: Register, Login, OAuth flows, Anonymous user creation (`/api/auth/*`)
- **Anonymous Routes**: Create anonymous user, retrieve by anonymous_id (public)
- **Protected Routes**: Profile management, password change, account deletion, social account linking
- **Anonymous Protected Routes**: Convert to complete, update preferences, delete anonymous user
- **OAuth Flows**: Web callback, mobile token-based authentication
- **API Structure**: RESTful design with standardized JSON responses

#### Key Files
- `app/Models/AppUser.php` - Mobile user model with Sanctum authentication and anonymous support
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AuthController.php` - User authentication endpoints
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AnonymousAuthController.php` - Anonymous user management (NEW)
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/SocialAuthController.php` - OAuth integration

- `routes/api.php` - Complete API routes for mobile app
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API documentation with 33 endpoints

### Multilingual Content System
The application implements a custom translation system for content:
- Main models (Poi, Event, Category, Media) have separate translation tables
- Translation models: `PoiTranslation`, `EventTranslation`, `CategoryTranslation`, `MediaTranslation`
- Each translation stores locale-specific content (name, description, etc.)
- Models have `translation()` method to get content for specific locale
- Accessor methods like `getNameAttribute()` automatically fetch translated content

### Admin Panel Structure
- **Authentication**: Custom admin authentication system with `AdminUser` model
- **Middleware**: `AdminAuth` middleware protects admin routes
- **Controllers**: Located in `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/`
- **Livewire Components**: Extensive use of Livewire for interactive admin interfaces in `app/Livewire/Admin/`

### Key Models and Relationships
- **Poi (Points of Interest)**: Main tourist attraction model with categories, media, and translations
- **Event**: Event management with registrations and reviews
- **Category**: Hierarchical categories for organizing content
- **Media**: File management system with translations for descriptions
- **AdminUser**: Admin authentication and authorization
- **AppUser**: Mobile app users with Sanctum authentication
- **EventRegistration**: Event booking system with payment support
- **OrganizationInfo**: Tourism organization information with multilingual support
- **ExternalLink**: External useful links management
- **Embassy**: Embassy information for both foreign embassies in Djibouti and Djiboutian embassies abroad

### Frontend Technologies
- **Livewire 3.6**: For reactive components
- **Bootstrap 5.3**: UI framework
- **Vite**: Asset bundling
- **SCSS/Sass**: Styling with custom admin theme
- **FontAwesome**: Icons
- **jQuery**: Legacy JavaScript support

### File Storage
- Media files stored in `storage/app/public/media/images/`
- Livewire temporary files in `storage/app/livewire-tmp/`
- Uses Intervention Image package for image processing

### Database
- **MySQL database** (NOT SQLite)
- Migrations follow Laravel conventions with timestamps
- Foreign key constraints with cascade deletes for translations

### Regions
The application is specifically designed for Djibouti with predefined regions:
- Djibouti, Ali Sabieh, Dikhil, Tadjourah, Obock, Arta

### Helper Functions
Global helper functions are autoloaded from `app/Helpers/functions.php` via Composer.

## OAuth Configuration Setup

For Google and Facebook authentication to work, you need to configure OAuth providers:

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# Facebook OAuth  
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=your_facebook_app_id
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_facebook_app_secret
```

### OAuth Provider Setup

#### Google Console Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable Google+ API
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add authorized redirect URIs:
   - `http://your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback` (development)
   - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/google/callback` (production)

#### Facebook Developer Setup
1. Go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)
2. Create a new app
3. Add Facebook Login product
4. Configure Valid OAuth Redirect URIs:
   - `http://your-domain.com/api/auth/facebook/callback` (development)
   - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/facebook/callback` (production)

## Testing
- PHPUnit configuration in `phpunit.xml`
- Test files in `tests/Feature/` and `tests/Unit/`
- Use `vendor/bin/phpunit` to run tests
